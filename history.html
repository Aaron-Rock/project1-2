            Harrisonburg was established in 1779 when Thomas Harrison gave two and half acres of his personal estate to be used by the public. The Harrison family owned the land now known as Rockingham County from 1737 until giving it over to Commonwealth of Virginia in 1778. The actual town of Harrisonburg was recognized a year later. In 1789, the Masonic Order was started and is still active in the city, making it the oldest organization in Harrisonburg to this day. The city grew over next couple decades. In 1861, the Civil War errupted in the surrounding area. In 1862, the courthouse was used to hold Union soldiers taken captive at the Battle of Cross Keys. Although Harrisonburg and Virginia were apart of the Confederate, their representatives opposed secession.

            In 1892, 1,092 acres of land were added to the City of Harrisonburg by annexation which assisted in increasing the population by threefold. The following year, the city established its first public school system to accommodate its growing residental population. The Virginia General Assembly opened the State Normal and Industrial School for Women in 1908 in Harrisonburg. This school was renamed in 1924 to State Teachers College and was renamed again to Madison College in 1938. Finally in 1977, the school was renamed for the last time to James Madison University and became a public state university. Rockingham Memorial Hospital was opened in Harrisonburg in 1912 and currently serves 4 surrounding counties as well as Rockingham county. Eastern Mennonite University was founded in 1917, giving the city 2 colleges with undergraduate, graduate and continuing education programs.

            There were several other annexations in the 20th century that brought the city's land total to 3,828 arces which is roughly 6 square-miles. The final annexation was in 1982 which left Harrisonburg with a total of 11.64 square-miles of land. This is the size of the city today. In more recent years, there have been efforts to rejuvinate the downtown area and bring in more money for the restaurants and small businesses. The two universities located in the area have definitely been instrumental in the revitalization of Harrisonburg. As of the census in 2020, the current population is 51,814 full-time residents.
