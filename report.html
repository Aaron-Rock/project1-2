            In this report, I wanted to summarize what I have done to meet the grading criteria associated with the static website project. My website is tailored to be a 'Guide to Harrisonburg' and outlines the history, restaurants and attractions to make up this amazing city. I have included 6 pages besides from this page to divide the content up in way that makes it easy for the user to access the information they want. When designing each page, I wanted to incorporate the beautiful scenery of the Shenandoah Valley and used those colors as my inspiration for navigation bar, headings, and backgrounds that flow throughout the website. Each page also neatly contains content about the topic as well as photos and extra links to provide more information if wanted. I included a favicon of a mountain with each page to incorporate more aspects of the Shenandoah Valley and the mountain range that surrounds it. My personal favorite feature is on the 'Restaurant' page where you can hover over each of the photos to see the same of the restaurant and then click it to be redirected to their menu. I think this was a great way to subtly include links and extra information without overwhelming the page. This website is available in two different formats, one compatiable with desktop / laptop computers and one with mobile devices so it possible to find your next stop on the go. You can reach the website through a secure or unsecure connection. If you have any additonal questions, comments or concerns, I encourage you to fill out the form on the 'References & Contact' page. Enjoy!
